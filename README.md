# TimeTraxTrends

An upgrade to TimeTrax_06-24-2016.  It adds more powerful querying capabilities allowing the user to define the query conditions to output a scatter plot.  The plot visualizes the number of hours worked, on the user defined task per month, for the user defined employee(s).

This is a functional beta version.  The GUI is currently command line based.  However, the visualizations provide valuable information to the managers of the customer service department.  It creates the ability for managers to monitor how there resources are allociated per month over time.

See the folloiwng images for examples of the output data visualizations:
