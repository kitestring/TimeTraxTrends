# TimeTraxTrends

An upgrade to TimeTrax_06-24-2016.  It adds more powerful querying capabilities allowing the user to define the query conditions to output a scatter plot that visualizes the number of hours worked, on a the user defined task per month, for the user defined employee(s).

This is a functional beta version.  The GUI is currently command line based.  However, the visualizations provide powerful information to the managers of the customer service department.
